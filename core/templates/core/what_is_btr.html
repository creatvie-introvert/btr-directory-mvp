                <p>
                    Build-to-Rent (BTR) is a modern way of renting where entire buildings or neighbourhoods are designed, owned, and professionally managed specifically for renters — not for sale.

                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>
                    Build-to-Rent developments are purpose-built rental homes operated by professional landlords rather than individual property owners. Unlike traditional renting, where properties are often owned by private landlords, BTR developments are designed from the ground up with renters in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Homes are typically modern, energy-efficient, and part of a larger managed community. Management, maintenance, and resident services are handled by an on-site or dedicated team, offering a more consistent and reliable renting experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Build-to-Rent has grown rapidly across UK cities, providing long-term rental options that prioritise quality, service, and stability.
